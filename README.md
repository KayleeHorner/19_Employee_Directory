# 19_Employee_Directory
![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue)

An app designed to display a list of random employees. Users can filter and sort to find a specific employee. I am having an extreme amount of trouble getting my information to pass in to the table. I have spent hours searching and have come up with a loss on how to fix this issue. Without it, I am unable to progress on this assignment.
